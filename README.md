Sitecore-Analytics-MultiSite
=======================

This is an attempt to extend Sitecore's analytics capabilities to better support multi-site / multi-tenant features. The intent is to define goals, page events, profiles and pattern cards, etc. for each tenant and have the ability to restrict use of these for only the sites for which they have been defined. And all of the configuration is done through Sitecore's Rule Engine.

More details about this module will be updated here as I make progress.

Am also looking for others to join the project and contribute.
